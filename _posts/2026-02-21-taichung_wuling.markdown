| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Taiwan is the land of trains. Railway abbreviations weave their way into your vocabulary: MRT for trips within Taipei, TR and HSR for the cities beyond. But it's also an island of mountain peaks the trains can't reach. Resting on its way to Taichung, my bike doesn't know what's coming. But I do. The highest paved road on the island... </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Not. So. Fast. Cow. Boy. Ten minutes into the ride, my water bottle bounces into the bushes. I hop off my bike to look for it and find I've got a flat, too. </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> A few minutes later, a local cyclist I'd bumped into at the train station hands me my water bottle. "Man, I don't know you, but you look a bit underprepared to go out alone at night. It's cold up there. No gloves? Your hands will freeze. You won't be able to brake on the way down. I got a car. Let me take you to Puli. It's a better starting point." </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> I slide the wheel back into the rear dropouts, insert the skewer, tighten the lever, and glance at my phone: 1 AM. This whole thing is starting to feel forced. I dragged myself out of bed, took two trains, circled the station struggling to find a way out, and now I'm fixing a flat with my hands all greasy. I agree, slightly [deflated](https://www.strava.com/activities/16805082962){:target="_blank"}. </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Next thing I know I'm in Puli, a small town at the foot of a mountain range. It's dead quiet at 3 AM. This is my new start. Yeehaw! </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Not. So. Fast. Cow. Boy. Gotta wash my hands first. That out of the way, ahead of me is a sloooooooooow grind: 25 miles with a 6.5% average grade. Takes me five hours to reach Wuling Pass. But here it is: the sea of clouds (雲海). And the frost on the handrail. Frost in Taiwan... </span> |

| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Concerned about turning into a popsicle on the way down, I pull two pairs of plastic food-handling gloves from my pocket. I got them at 7-Eleven. Along with two rubber bands to keep the air out. The plan is to [Roll Safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_Safe){:target="_blank"}. </span> |
| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Climbing is fun. Rolling downhill for 70 miles? Terrifying. It is too steep and cold to have my phone out. Such a shame I don't have my GoPro with me either, because the 30-mile ride back to Puli is a visual journey. </span> |
| <span style="font-size: 16px;"> Back in Puli, I peel off my windbreaker. The air is warmer, the ground flatter. Feels strange to be back. The final 40 miles are a slight downhill back to Taichung where my journey began. A gradual return to civilization. More lights, more traffic, and, finally, trains... again. </span> |
